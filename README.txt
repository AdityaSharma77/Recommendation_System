Basic recommendation system, namely collaborative and content based, utilize user and product data for generating genuine recommendations. But any new product / new user /whole new system runs into a problem of having no such information about user preferences or detailed product description leading to cold start problem. 

Along with cold start, recommendation systems come across issues like sparsity, scalability, diversity etc. In this project we try to create a hybrid recommendation system, combining the above-mentioned systems to combat cold start. The dataset involved in the project was based on user review from Amazon. We combined products/datasets for two different categories of products namely groceries and electronic appliances. 

We use nearest neighborsâ€™ algorithm for collaborative system while content-based employs TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text to a mathematical representation to perform comparisons. Both these systems calculate the nearest or closest product based on cosine similarity. The dataset had to be limited based on hardware capabilities since creating user profile and vectorization of products consume high level of RAM. 

For hybrid system we first run the content-based algorithm and use output of that as an input for knn-algorithm. To overcome cold start in hybrid system we run knn-algorithm on the first recommendation generated by content based thereby only depending on the products available in the database.

Apart from generating recommendations we predict the ratings for our input product and compare it with actual ratings available in the dataset. We perform predictive and classification analysis by comparing predicted and actual ratings and evaluate the performance of each system and figure out the best possible system. By printing the recommendations generated by each system we also observe the different way in which they work and how diverse the recommendations are. 

We compare the performance of each system for different products since ratings differ and that can affect the overall performance. We discuss the issues faced and the possibilities of recommendation systems going ahead.
