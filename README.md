Overview
The hybrid recommendation system aims to provide accurate and relevant recommendations by combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches. Collaborative filtering leverages the behavior and preferences of similar users, while content-based filtering focuses on item characteristics and similarities.

Installation
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hybrid-recommendation-system.git

2. Install the required libraries and dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:
python main.py

Usage
To use the hybrid recommendation system:
1. Ensure that the necessary data is available and properly formatted. The system expects a CSV file containing user ratings and item attributes.
2. Configure the system parameters and algorithm settings according to your needs. Adjust the k-value for the KNN algorithm, choose the similarity metric, and customize other relevant parameters.
3. Run the system to generate recommendations for users. The output will provide a list of recommended items based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

Data
The recommendation system requires data in the form of user ratings and item attributes. The provided code assumes that the data is available in a CSV file named "Amazon_Reviews.csv". Ensure that the data is correctly formatted and contains the necessary columns.

Algorithm
The hybrid recommendation system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is implemented using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find similar users or items. Content-based filtering utilizes item attributes and calculates item similarities based on text analysis techniques such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Evaluation
The system includes evaluation metrics to measure its performance. Precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to assess the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations. These metrics provide insights into the system's effectiveness in capturing user preferences and suggesting suitable items.

Results
The system generates personalized recommendations based on user preferences and item similarities. The results can be analyzed and evaluated using the provided evaluation metrics. The performance of the recommendation system can be further optimized by fine-tuning the algorithm parameters and data preprocessing techniques.
